# Introduction

`fwd` is a toolchain for Docker commands and environment configuration. It has some very useful commands that abstracts some specific tasks, long commands, environment configuration, etc. It can be used for both development and production environments.

It provides an elegant and simple way to use the same commands all over the place - local and development, CI tools, staging and production. It was created to be used manly for Laravel projects, but it is extensible to run on several different stacks.

It is built on top of [Laravel Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) and is [open source](https://github.com/fireworkweb/fwd/).
